// Problem Description: Create a Java class and initialize an integer array of size 5. 
//Create two methods, one method will store the marks of 5 subjects in the array and 
//another method will display the data from the array. Traverse the array using enhanced for loop.
public class EnhancedForLoopPractice {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		String student = "Loo";

		double grades = 70.00;

		int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

		for (int i : arr) { // The iteration in the loop happens automatically. The value is assigned to
			// variable i from the array in every iteration of the loop.
// balance += deposit; // Loop will repeat the statements in its body till the
// last element is
// reached in the array.
			
			double gradesoo = grades + 5.00;
			String studentoo = student + "loo";
			
			System.out.println("Student " + i + " is " + studentoo + " who's grade is " + gradesoo);
